# LaxarJS - laxar-jasmine-runner

> Small runner for jasmine tests loaded asynchronously in an ES2015 environment.

While widgets and activities are tested using [LaxarJS Mocks](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar-mocks), the building blocks of LaxarJS itself need a simpler tool to asynchronously load and run jasmine tests.
This library provides the boilerplate code necessary to achieve just that.
